# backup-server
In this project we created a server side and a client side to back up files and folders.
The client first registers with the server, and the server registers it as one of its users.
Then any change in the client's destination folder will be updated by the server. A registered customer can connect
through another computer and get all his information to that computer. Multiple clients can upload files to the server
at the same time, or download from the server at the same time
